# For this project, I used the following Spotify data table.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Next, I performed analytics on the Spotify data using SQL. 

#First I wondered the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined who the Top 5 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

#What is the average danceability by artist and track? 
SELECT artist_name, track, avg(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#What are the top 10 tracks based on popularity? 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name, track, avg(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY track;
LIMIT 10;
